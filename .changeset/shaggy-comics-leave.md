**Change margin collapse guard from padding to display table**

The styles object returned from `capsize` no longer contains a `padding` property (also removed the `height` property from the pseudo elements). This was previously used to prevent the negative margins from collapsing.

The technique has been swapped out in favour of using `display: table` on the pseudo elements, which also required an inversion of the negative margin direction.
