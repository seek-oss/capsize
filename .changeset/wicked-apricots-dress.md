createFontStack: Prefer `postscriptName` or `fullName` for fallback source

The `@font-face` declaration aliases generated by `createFontStack` now favour `postscriptName` and `fullName` over `familyName` from the provided metrics when selecting a local font face as a fallback.

MDN recommends using either `fullName` and `postscriptName` when accessing local fonts to ensure the best matching across platforms, while also enabling selection of a single font face within a larger family, e.g. `Arial Bold` or `Arial-BoldMT` within `Arial`.
For details see [MDN].

> ⚠️ Note: Falling back to `familyName` (original behaviour) makes this work backwards compatible with older versions of font metrics.
